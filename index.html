		<h1><a name="essay1">Intrusive Advertising</a></h1>
		
	<p>Browsing the internet has become an almost unbearable experience without an adblock extension or browser. Reading articles or visiting small blogs (or even going through your facebook feed) can become so frustrating because of intrusive advertising that instead of incentivizing users to continue browsing or look further into the subject of the ad, it makes them leave and turn to different websites that will provide a better user experience. Intrusive advertising isn’t only annoying for the user, it can sometimes completely render websites unreachable or unusable, particularly on mobile when an ad redirects to a different page or covers the whole screen with an impossible-to-close ad. It is easy to understand why advertising is inevitable; its purpose is “to provide revenue to the publisher and returns to the advertiser” <span class="footnum">1</span> which then allows the publisher to keep their website and content alive. However, publishers don’t focus on user experience but on creating a revenue, and this results in intrusive ads that ultimately hurt their image or force users to use an adblock in order to access the content. As a student and designer, this issue is incredibly relevant since the internet has become my main tool for research, inspiration and even entertainment; it is rare that I try to read articles on mobile anymore and I even more rarely disable adblock when browsing on my laptop. As such, I wanted to look into this subject for the final website; I would explain what intrusive advertising is along with different types of intrusive advertising, why people use adblock, the effects of adblock, and the effectiveness of non-intrusive advertising.</p>
	
	<p>In terms of design, I would like to create an interactive website mainly using typography and flat graphics. I would incorporate representations of intrusive advertising to present the content, but do so in a way that is visually appealing and user friendly. I would use this approach as a way to mock these ads as well allow readers to interact with the website. I would also like to use bright, contrasting colors to create the in-your-face feeling that intrusive ads do, while at the same time enticing the reader to explore further. Titles and body text would also be contrasted through the use of size and sans-serif and display fonts and will often be integrated into the graphics. The navigation would make use of the hamburger icon in order to bring up a full page menu, but the images in the website will also be used to navigate through the different pages.</p>
	
	<p>In terms of content, the website would have a landing page, three content pages and an additional “About” page explaining the goal of the project. The landing page would contain a simple graphic that portrays some of the most hated types of intrusive advertising and then leads towards the content of the first page: “intrusive ads”. In this page, intrusive advertising would be defined as ads that disrupt user experience, interrupt the content on a page and/or slow down browsing and loading.<span class="footnum">2</span> It would then present more specific reasons as to why users have come to dislike online ads and their opinions on them, which in turn provides the typical user’s perspective on the problem. For example, according to a survey of around 1000 people done by HubSpot, 91% agreed that ads have become more intrusive than they were 2-3 years ago, yet 83% agree that not all ads are bad but that there needs to be a way to filter the obnoxious ones.<span class="footnum">3</span> A majority of people believe that ads “being displayed now are not compelling—they are deceptive, intrusive and disruptive.”<span class="footnum">4</span> In fact, most people who click on online ads do so on accident or were deceived by the content of the ad, rather than because they are interested or attracted by the ad itself.<span class="footnum">5</span> This provides insight on the fact that it is the “annoying” ads, such as pop-up and auto-playing ads, that have truly become a problem in the world of online advertising. I would then move on to present different types of intrusive advertising as standardized by the Coalition for Better Ads as well as misleading tactics used to make them difficult to escape. The Coalition for Better Ads is an organization formed by several companies, including Google and Facebook, that aims to create standards for online advertising in order to provide a better user experience while still allowing content creators and organizations to create revenue through online ads.<span class="footnum">6</span> They provide 12 types of ads, 4 on desktop and 8 on mobile (some of which repeat on both platforms), that are considered intrusive and fall below the threshold of “consumer acceptability”: pop-up ads, prestitial ads, mobile pages with more than 30% ad density, flashing animations, poststitial ads that require a countdown to dismiss, fullscreen scrollover ads, large sticky ads, and auto-playing videos with sound.<span class="footnum">7</span> Some of the best known misleading tactics are hiding the “close” button on a pop-up, using an auto-play feature or linking to a page that has nothing to do with the ad or the content itself.<span class="footnum">8</span> </p>
	
	<p>The second page would be “Adblock”. In this page, I would define an adblock as an extension that prevents users from encountering most online advertising by automatically hiding the ads when visiting a page. I would then explain the causes and the problems caused by adblocks. Adblock is a result of intrusive advertising, as more and more people grow tired of bad online advertising. Mehmood Hanif, who is a marketing strategist for Bad Ad Johnny (a well-known adblock extension), “estimates that the average Internet user is served 11,250 ads per month, which he bases on the number of times the software blocks a banner or pop-up”.<span class="footnum">9</span> While not necessarily all of these might be intrusive advertising, it is difficult for the user to know on which website they’ll be bombarded with auto-playing videos and which will have reasonable ads; this leads to most people blocking all ads to improve their browsing experience. This means big problems for organizations and content producers who rely on advertising in order to create revenue. It is estimated that if ad blocking continues in its upward trend, combined with the fact that many publishers and advertisers ineffectively try to combat it by doing things such as blocking access to a website if adblock is on, publishers will lose $35 billion by 2020.<span class="footnum">10</span> Google, with the Coalition for Better Ads, hope to change this by creating a better user experience and blocking ads that are truly annoying. “Advertising makes up 86% of Google’s revenue”<span class="footnum">11</span> so it is in Google’s (and many organizations’) best interest to change the way advertising affects users and encourage ad consumption.</p>
	
	<p>The third page would touch upon some tips on non intrusive advertising and how it can entice users to click on ads without disrupting the content or flow of the page. Positioning, for example, is a good example of ways to improve ad consumption. The positioning of sections such as “other products you may like” at the bottom of pages “is such that the web user does not even realise that he is consuming an ad but also willingly goes through what the brands offer”<span class="footnum">12</span> and in doing so increases the chances of them buying. “Substantial, subtle and smart advertising is the key to success.”<span class="footnum">13</span> It is all about showing relevant content at the right place and the right time; the minute an ad disturbs the user experience, it can be considered intrusive and creates a negative image of both the brand or service and the webiste.</p>
